## General Info
The code, here, is written in the course of working through *The Rust Book*.

## Technologies Used
We're just using the usual Rust programming language here, as well as, libraries to create the projects.
As the code is written based on the material contain in the Rust book referenced above, the programming language used is *Rust*.

## Contents
### Hello
### Guessing Game
### Ownership

## Setup
Simply change from the main directory of *rust-code* to the directory that contains the relevant code.

## Running the Code
We can start out by creating a new project by:
'''
cargo new <project-name>
'''
, which will create the full structure for a project to be instantiated. Then, the project can either be built or run.

An existing project can be built by the command,
'''
cargo build
'''
This command will bring in code from libraries specified in Cargo.toml and build other code necessary for the project. It will also run the project.

To just run the project without doing any of the above, '''
cargo run
'''
And the project will run in the command line.

## Project Status
Until I have worked through the book, this repository will still be a work in progress. After that time, it will be a reference for future Rust endeavors.

## Room for Improvement
There is always room for improvement in any coding project as skills and possibilities for further functionality may come along.
