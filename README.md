## General Info
These examples are created from following along with the standard Rust book. Any projects created after working through the book will be kept as another project.

## Technologies Used
We're just using the usual Rust programming language here, as well as, libraries to create the projects.

## Features

## Setup
No real setup is necessary with these projects. Just navigate to the directory and run the project from there.

## Running the Code
We can start out by creating a new project by:
'''
cargo new <project-name>
'''
, which will create the full structure for a project to be instantiated. Then, the project can either be built or run.

An existing project can be built by the command,
'''
cargo build
'''
This command will bring in code from libraries specified in Cargo.toml and build other code necessary for the project. It will also run the project.

To just run the project without doing any of the above, '''
cargo run
'''
And the project will run in the command line.

## Project Status
Until I have worked through the book, this repository will still be a work in progress. After that time, it will be a reference for future Rust endeavors.

## Room for Improvement
There is always room for improvement in any coding project as skills and possibilities for further functionality may come along.
